 * Register all event handlers for the bot.

 * Each event module exports a `register(client)` function,
 * which attaches one or more listeners to the Discord client.
 *
 * - ready.ts:        Handles bot startup (config load + command deployment).
 * - housingInteraction.ts: Handles housing-related custom interactions (buttons, menus).
 * - interactionCreate.ts: Main router for slash commands, autocomplete, and UI interactions.
 *
 * By centralizing registration here, the botâ€™s entrypoint (index.ts)
 * can just call `registerEvents(client)` instead of wiring events manually.
